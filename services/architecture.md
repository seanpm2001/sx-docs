# Architecture

To enhance the user experience of interacting with the protocol, we offer a number of additional off-chain services. All of these products are fully open source in the [Snapshot Labs Github organization](https://github.com/snapshot-labs). These are all completely optional and therefore do not introduce any censorship concerns.&#x20;

* [**SX UI**](ui.md)**:** An easy to use interface for interacting with the protocol.&#x20;
* [**SX API**](api.md)**:** A fast and efficient indexer for all the protocol data.&#x20;
* [**SX.js**](sx.js.md)**:** A Typescript SDK that can be used to build 3rd Party Integrations with the protocol. &#x20;
* [**Mana**](mana.md)**:** A meta-transaction relayer that can provide a way for proposal creation and vote costs to be sponsored.
