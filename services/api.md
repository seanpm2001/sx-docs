# API

The API indexes Snapshot X data. Specifically, it monitors events emitted by spaces and space factories so that votes, proposals, and the deployment of new spaces can be tracked. Anyone can run the API. It uses [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com) on EVM chains and [Checkpoint](https://checkpoint.box) on Starknet.
